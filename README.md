    Migraine Aura Simulation v1.0.
    Developed by Robert William Blennerhed, Migraineur.
    
    I have suffered from migraine aura since I was 7 years old.
    For decades, I have searched for a solution, testing medications,
    tracking patterns, and even developing my own software,
    since 1994 in Basic, object Pascal, C, C++ and now in Python.
    
    Now at 67 years old, I am still fighting for an answer.
    Like Bill Bixbyâ€™s character in The Incredible Hulk,
    I am constantly searching for a way to stop the transformation,
    before the migraine takes control.
